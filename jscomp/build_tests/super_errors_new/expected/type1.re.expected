  [1;31m1[0m [2mâ”‚[0m let x = [1;31m2.[0m + 2;
  
  This has type:
    [1;31mfloat[0m
  But somewhere wanted:
    [1;33mint[0m

You can convert a [1;33mfloat[0m to a [1;33mint[0m with [1;33mint_of_float[0m.If this is a literal, you want a number without a trailing dot (e.g. [1;33m20[0m).
